# Active Travel & Noise Pollution

## An exploratory study on the association between noise pollution, urban forms and function, and the choice of transportation modes

Noise pollution is problematic in highly urbanised areas, impacting adversely on active commuting experiences. The potential rippling effects of noise pollution on transportation choices inform the studyâ€™s intent. Using London as a case, the study explored the association between noise pollution, urban forms and functions and the mode of transportation to work. Results show cyclists are more vulnerable to high noise levels, whereas pedestrians are more exposed to mid-range noise levels, with urban density and diversity positively correlated with noise pollution.
